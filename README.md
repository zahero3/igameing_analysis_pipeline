🎰 iGaming Data Analysis Pipeline using Apache Airflow

**Overview**
**This project showcases my expertise in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and machine learning (ML) models for the iGaming industry using Apache Airflow. The pipeline automates data collection, transformation, and analysis while also training two ML models to predict player churn and revenue trends.
Designed for scalability and efficiency, this pipeline helps iGaming operators gain real-time insights, optimize marketing strategies, predict revenue fluctuations, and improve player retention.**
